# Echo_AI
Echo AI is a research-oriented, modular artificial intelligence system designed to support structured clinical documentation, AI-assisted consultation workflows, and human-in-the-loop medical decision support.

Echo AI is not a diagnostic system.
It is designed to assist clinicians by organizing information, generating structured summaries, and improving workflow efficiency — with final authority always retained by licensed professionals.
